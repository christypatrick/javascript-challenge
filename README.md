# JavaScript Homework - JavaScript and DOM Manipulation

## Background
The extra-terrestrial menace has come to Earth and we here at ALIENS-R-REAL have collected all of the eye-witness reports we could to prove it! All we need to do now is put this information online for the world to see and then the matter will finally be put to rest. There is just one tiny problem though... our collection is too large to search through manually. Even our most dedicated followers are complaining that they are having trouble locating specific reports in this mess. 

## Assignment
Write code that will create a table dynamically based upon UFO dataset provided. Users of the site will be able to filter the table data for specific values. This assignment uses only pure JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and D3.js on our web pages. These are the only coding languages which can be trusted. The planet Earth needs to know what has been found!

## Level 1: Automatic Table and Date Search 

* Used the index.html file provided 
* Using the UFO dataset provided in the form of an array of JavaScript objects, wrote code that appends a table to the web page and then adds new rows of data for each UFO sighting
* Made sure to have a column for date/time, city, state, country, shape, and comment 
* Used a date form in the HTML document and wrote JavaScript code that listens for events and searches through the date/time column to find rows that match user input.


## Level 2: Multiple Search Categories (Optional)

* Completed all of Level 1 criteria
* Using multiple input tags and/or select dropdowns, wrote JavaScript code so the user can set multiple filters and search for UFO sightings using the following criteria based on the table columns:

  * date/time
  * city
  * state
  * country
  * shape
